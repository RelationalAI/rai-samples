## RelationalAI Samples

This repository contains samples of using the RelationalAI platform. Samples will each have their own folder under the `samples` subdirectory.  They may be simply a Python or Jupyter Notebook file, in which case they be installed and run using PyRel.  If they require data setup, they will likely have a README.md and SQL files to instruct in setup.  

All samples currently require the use of the RelationalAI Native App available on the Snowflake Marketplace.
